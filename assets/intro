Hi their :).

My project
My blogging/ knowledge base website project: https://blog.insanelogs.xyz/

Some history behind the name "insanelogs"
My alias or name I used in gaming from childhood is : "insane"
Therefore insanelogs translates to Logs of Insane (me).

What is this website for?
My goal with this website is to log and share interesting topics of computer science I learn everyday in such a way that people can get started on it quickly in a practical sense, and later deep diver on their own like its inner mechanics / workings.

I believe its much better to have something working and functional to at least play or tinker with before reading a ton of theory on it.
