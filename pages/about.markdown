### Insanelogs ?? What is this name ??
My alias or name I used in gaming from childhood is : “insane”
Therefore Insanelogs translates to Logs of Insane (me).

### What is this website for ?
My goal with this website is to log and share interesting topics of computer science I learn everyday in such a way that people can get started on it quickly in a practical sense, and later dive deeper on their own like its inner mechanics / workings. I mostly try to choose topics which on which simple and easy information is not present or they are unheard of.

I believe its much better to have something working and functional to at least play or tinker with before reading a ton of theory on it. This is the main motto of my website.

Please don’t be shy to donate me all of your salary. I will gladly accept it. Peace
