Border and outline are two ways to add borders around an element in HTML/CSS.  
But they donâ€™t behave the same.

Border **respects margins** between two elements and never spills out.  
On the other hand, an **outline** doesnâ€™t care about margins â€” it can **overflow** and bleed into other elements.

---

Let us understand this with a simple example:

Here I have created two ``<div>s`` box1 and box2 having a space (margin) of 10px between them.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
        <style>
            * {
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
                margin: 10px;
            }

            .box1 {
                outline: 1px solid black;
            }

            .box2 {
                border: 1px solid black;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="box1">Box 1 uses outline</div>

        <div class="box2">Box 2 uses margin</div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now, no matter how much I increase the **border** size in box2, the spacing between the two elements is still maintained.  
Here I increased the border size to 50px and space between the two boxes is still maintained.

```html
<style>
    * {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
          margin: 10px;
      }

      .box1 {
          outline: 1px solid black;
      }

      .box2 {
          border: 50px solid black; /* Border size increased to 50px */
      }
</style>
```

But when I increase the **outline** size in box1 to 15px, it simply ignores that 10px space and **overflows** into box2. (Extra: Yes 5px bleeds into box2 from box2â€™s upper border)

```html
<style>
    * {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
          margin: 10px;
      }

      .box1 {
          outline: 15px solid black; /* Outline size increased to 15px */
      }

      .box2 {
          border: 1px solid black;
      }
</style>
```

Same thing happens when outline-offset property of box1 is increased.  
  
**Note:** Outline offset simply controls how far the outline is pushed **outward or inward** from its default position.

```html
<style>
    * {
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
          margin: 10px;
      }

      .box1 {
          outline: 15px solid black;
          outline-offset: 15px; 
          /* Outline-offset property set to 15px. Default value is 0px. */
      }

      .box2 {
          border: 1px solid black;
      }
</style>
```

Thatâ€™s all. Hope it clears the basic difference border and outline in CSS. I have tried to kept the example as simple and possible.  
Thank you :]
