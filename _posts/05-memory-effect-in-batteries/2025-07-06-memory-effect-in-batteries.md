**Memory effect** is also known as **battery effect**, **lazy battery effect**, or **battery memory**. It an issue observed mostly in nickel-cadmium batteries (Ni-Cd) and to some extent Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries.  
  
It is condition where a battery forgets its maximum capacity and instead remembers a smaller one. Thus it shows full even though its not.

<br>

**Why it happens?**  
This usually happens if we **charge the batteries very frequently**, like plugging it every time it drops to 50 or 40 percent. This is also called **partial charging**.  
  
In reality it is not so simple to understand as to what really happens, but we can get an idea of what it is with a simple analogy. You can always dive deeper on your own if you got the curiosity ;] !

<br>

**Simple analogy**  
Let us understand it with a **liters analogy**.  
  
Suppose a battery has a capacity of **1 lite**r. When you fill all **1 liter** it gets fully charged and shows **100%**. But over time due to partial charging the battery forgets this capacity and thinks **500ml** is its full capacity. So next time when you fill it up to **500ml** only, the battery will think it has reached its full capacity. It wonâ€™t accept any more water (charge). It will thus show **100%** even though it actually isnâ€™t.

**Please note** this is a very simplified analogy just to get the gist of the concept. You are free to comment and point out any mistakes I made :] .  

<br>

** The most common fix**  
It is often fixable by completely draining the battery to 0% and recharging it back to 100%. It is known as re calibrating the battery.  

<br>

**What about modern batteries?**  
Today, most devices use **Lithium-ion (Li-Ion)** or **Lithium Polymer (Li-Po)** batteries. These **donâ€™t suffer from memory effect**, and **partial charging is fine** for them.

However, since theyâ€™re still made of chemical compounds, **they will naturally wear down over time**, and their **maximum capacity will reduce**. This isnâ€™t the memory effect â€” itâ€™s just normal aging.
