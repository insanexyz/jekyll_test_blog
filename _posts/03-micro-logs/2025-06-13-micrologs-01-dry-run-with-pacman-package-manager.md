Dry run with pacman package manager

**`Source:`** [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman)  
**`pacman:`** Package manager for Arch Linux

**``-p``** flag can be used with pacman to **dry run** commands â€” that is, see what your command is going to do **before** it actually does anything.

Might not work with certain flag combinations like **``-n``**, and it will simply throw an error. 

Flags used in the command -
- **`R`**: **`--remove`** - removes the specified package.
- **`s`**: **`--recursive`** - removes the package and its dependencies that are no longer required by any other installed package.
- **`n`**: **`--nosave`** - removes the package's configuration files as well.

---

**Optional explanation with simple examples** -

**``pacman -Rns`` :** To remove a package and its dependencies which are not required by any other installed package.

1. Normal Behavior -

2. **-p** flag works well and shows a list of the final packages which will be removed. It only shows what **`Pacman -Rs`** is going to do instead of asking for deletion confirmation to proceed further. -

3. **``-p``** doesnâ€™t work when used with **``-n``** flag -
