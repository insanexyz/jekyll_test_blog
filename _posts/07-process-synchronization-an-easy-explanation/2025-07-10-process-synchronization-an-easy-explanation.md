**Process Synchronization** is simply about running multiple processes that are accessing the same common resource (or resources) in a specific, controlled order so that everything goes smoothly and thereâ€™s no conflict.

Here, multiple processes (or even threads) could be sharing resources like a file, a database, or some part of the memory â€” and synchronization ensures that they donâ€™t mess things up for each other.

A simple example:  
Imagine we have a database and two programs â€“ Program A and Program B.

- Program A is responsible for adding/ updating (writing) a record to the database.
- Program B is responsible for reading a record from the database.

![Diagram illustrating a database with 5 rows and two process A and B. Process A wants to update record 5 while at the same time process B wants to read record 5. This makes the database sad as these are two conflicting types of operations being performed at the same time](/assets/process-synchronization-an-easy-explanation/diagram.webp)

Now, there are 5 records in the database. Program B wants to read record 5, while Program A wants to edit and update record 5. If both programs attempt to access the record simultaneously, it could lead to problems, such as Program B reading a half-updated record.  
  
To avoid this, **synchronization** is essential. The solution here is to lock the resource while either program is using it. If Program B decides to read record 5, the database should be locked from Program Aâ€™s access. This ensures that Program B reads the complete, unaltered data. (However program B here would be reading old data which is later updated)  
  
Similarly, when Program A is updating the record, the database should be locked for Program Bâ€™s access. Once Program A has finished updating this lock is released.  
  
**Note:** Multiple programs that only want to read from the same database can do so simultaneously without locking each other out. This is because reading data doesnâ€™t change anything, so one programâ€™s reading doesnâ€™t affect anotherâ€™s.  
  
Well that was all.
